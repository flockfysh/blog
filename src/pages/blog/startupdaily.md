## New Partnership and Collaboration with…
We are delighted to announce a new partnership. The startup agency we collaborated with helps the most promising startups is none other than [Startup Founder Daily](https://www.startupfounderdaily.com/). They are on a mission to amplify Founders and their Startups through provided resources and through helping early-stage startups gain audience traction and drive awareness. Startup Founder Daily has a very engagement-based community on different social media channels and is providing startups its community to borrow their audience and share the story, get some brand or product awareness, and hopefully get some early-stage traction.

## How did we get into Startup Founder Daily?

Soon after we started to focus on our marketing plan we’ve thought if there is any non-profit helping startups for free. As soon as we encountered Startup Founder Daily their value proposition got us to apply. However, as a startup, you can get all the proposal benefits, if you place under the top 3 startups of the week, based on the number of votes/number of people supporting us. What we’ve done to place in the top 3 is talking to potential users. We proposed to analyze their problem and proposed solutions to remove the hassle of building datasets. After the end of the week, we got a personal email from the Startup Founder Daily founder himself, inviting us to join the program. We accepted it as soon as possible and now we’re in talks to optimize our cooperation.

This is only just the beginning of a new journey. flockfysh is here to revolutionize the way we create datasets and use them in AI or ML Projects. We're doing this through automation, cost-efficiency, and the potential to create top-notch data.
