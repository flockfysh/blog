Together, in unison with CITRIS, we are steps closer on our journey towards making personalized datasets and AI a reality. With the backing of CITRIS, we strengthen our partnerships to make this vision more concrete.

## What's flockfysh again?

flockfysh is a platform you can build datasets and accompanying AI models in a snap of your fingers. Think of it as the ChatGPT of data. Rapid, affordable, and top notch.

## Why CITRIS Foundry

CITRIS has repeatedly topped our minds as the premier research SV incubator. Providing us with broader connections and access to the collective resources of California's crown jewel UC system, we are honored and excited to work with the brightest minds in AI.

Together, with [Raymond Tian](https://twitter.com/rymdtian), we'll be participating in the Spring '23 batch.

This is just the beginning of a new journey and I'm looking forward to sharing every step of the way with you all!
